            <h2>The same interface is provided for both trainer and client to register and sign in</h2>
            <p>AirFitness is a workout scheduling and payment system for personal trainers and their clients to create a
                personal workout that is updated live so that they both see the same informtion. Signing up is quick,
                easy, free and secure. We use the Stripe payment system so that there is no extra work for either the
                trainer or client to deal with. All billing is handled automatically. Your personal data is safe with
                us, we utilize the highest levels of server security and encryption.
            </p>
            <h2>Workout class categories are created by the trainer in all the different types of classes they offer
            </h2>
            <p>The menu provides a choice of trainers for the clients to choose from. The trainers are able to easily
                create a menu of categories on the types of workouts they provide, ie. yoga, insanity, ripped, high,
                pilates, etc. This makes it easy for clients to search through for the best trainer and types of
                workouts each of them provide. The categories sections makes it easy for the trainer as the client sees
                the same interface and can see what all the trainer provides. So its easy for the client to narrow down
                the type of workouts they need at certain times and find the best trainer available for that time.

            <h2>The trainer can create classes with date and location for clients to choose from</h2>
            <p>At any time trainers can create classes and provide important information about the class, date, time,
                location, duration of workout. Once the client has decided what kind of workout they want, its an easy
                matter of finding a trainer inside the category of that workout that best fits their schedule. So the
                client is able to manage appointments with many different trainers in many different types of workout
                that best fit their lifestyle. This allows for the trainer to schedule multiple clients in many
                different exercise disaplins quickly so that clients are made immediately aware that they are available.
            </p>
            <h2>Using the app is easy, for each class the clients buys punchcards that gets updated as theyre used</h2>
            <p>All training appointments are sold as punchcards of 10 sessions. This makes it convenient for both the
                trainer and client to cancel and reschedule and not be commited to a certain date or time. Automatic
                notifications are sent out when either the trainer or client make changes to class scheduling or class
                attendence. No more wading through giant websites and trying to synchronize it with your schedule, all
                appointments can be viewed in out built in calender. Now your workout routine for the month can be
                viewed in a glance. And remember, this app is free, you get all this convenience for free.</p>
